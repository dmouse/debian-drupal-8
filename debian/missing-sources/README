This directory holds the sources for code included in Drupal8 which
comes from third party repositories and is modified from their source
state — Often by means of Javascript minification and the like. The
main source for this is the core/core.libraries.yml, and the build
output from Lintian.

The core/core.libraries.yml file is monitored for changes by comparing
its SHA256 to debian/missing-sources/tracking.sha256 as part of the
package build process.

Licensing details for all bundled libraries: Refer to
debian/copyright; details on where each missing source was downloaded
from will be listed on this file.
